        <h4>Research Excellence</h4>
        <p >Computer Science department is engaged and committed to incept projects of<br />
            institutional and national importance in the themes of Research, Innovation and<br />
            Technology Transfer. These projects involve local, regional and international<br />
            collaborations and networks and building strategic partnerships.<br />
            The overarching aims of the projects are to:<br />
            <ul>
              <li>Strengthen the Department of Computer Science and University's research<br />
                capacity- this to provide a concrete realization of the university research<br />
                strategy and vision;</li>
                <li>Stimulate multidisciplinary intra and inter faculty research,</li>
                <li>Enhance local, regional and international collaborations and to provide<br />
                  outreach and visibility.</li>
                  <li>Develop capacity in Innovation, Technology Transfer and Intellectual<br />
                    Property</li>
                    <li>Stimulation of grassroots innovation and interfacing with Technology<br />

        		<h2>E-Health Research Cluster</h2>
        		<p>The main aim of the research cluster is to provide a centre to bring together people
			and projects which are concerned with undertaking research in the field of health
			informatics, especially mobile health which is relevant for a low resourced country
			such as Botswana. The cluster has secured a laboratory at the Faculty of health
			Sciences which currently has 5 Personal computers dedicated to 5 specific
			projects.</p>

	        		<h2>Mobile Computing research and innovation Laboratory</h2>
	        		<p>The department is setting up of a Mobile Computing Research and Innovation Lab(MCRL). MCRL aims to provide capacity building and upskilling of researchers, innovators, and entrepreneurs to help in exploring technology intervention in solving local problems. The proposed lab will stimulate research and innovation in mobile
				computing and applications to find technology solutions of local relevance across sectors of health, education, agriculture, tourism, transport and others. The proposed lab will also aim to impart technical skills to students, entrepreneurs and innovators through capacity building and technical training activities in partnership
				with Industry and international strategic partners through co-creation platforms.</p>
				<p>The lab aims to achieve this by being a center that gives mobile application developers a platform to develop mobile applications, validate and to launch them into the virtual mobile market ecosystems. The project aims also to explore synergies and build collaborations with South Africa's University of Stellenbosch
				Innovus LaunchLab accelerator, University of Botswana Global Business Labs, mLabs Southern Africa and Namibia Business Innovation Centre (NBIC) mobile
				computing lab. The Department has entered into collaboration with Southern African Innovation Support programme through the SAIS TTO project in order to facilitate this.

	        		<h2>Intelligent Systems Research lab</h2>
	        		<p>The planned Intelligent Systems Research lab will be concerned with design and analysis of autonomous agents. These will be software systems, initially, but later physical machines also, that can perceive their environments, act in manners that optimize some performance measure, and interact with their
				environments, including human beings. Intelligent systems are the area in the ACM Computer Science 2013 Curriculum which deals with Artificial Intelligence. It basically takes problem solving to a higher level, and concerns itself with problem solving in areas such as Image Recognition, Speech
				ecognition, Machine Learning, Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, Search, Reasoning, etc. In modern software design, Intelligent Systems are becoming more and more crucial to success of systems, because the types of problems encountered require dealing with very complex problems
				(such as automated driving), complex data, as well as large quantities of data, and real time decision making.
				</p>
				<p>The planned Intelligent Systems Research lab will have several Intel-based multicore high-end workstations running Linux and Windows. It will also be supported with a multiprocessing server with large memory and file storage for handling large data. Focus will be on both theoretical and applied research.
				Theoretical research will look into issues such as support for faster search algorithms, with appropriate data structures and heuristics. Applied research will look at problem solving in areas that are problematic in Botswana as well as Southern Africa, such as health care, mining, education, and business.
				</p>
				<p>The lab will be supported by an undergraduate stream in the Bachelor of Computer Science programme in the department, which currently has two courses at year three and four levels. We expect to support undergraduate research, such as in final year projects, to better prepare undergraduate
				students for graduate research.</p>
				<p>Naturally, the MSc and PhD programmes will feed into the lab. There is already great interest among graduate students to pick topics in Artificial Intelligence, due to it being a hot topic.The lab will also be supported by the Decision and Intelligent Systems teaching cluster in the department. It is envisioned that it will
				take one year for the lab to become fully operational.</p>

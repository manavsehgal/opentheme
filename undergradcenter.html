      <h3>Computer Science Undergraduate Center</h3>
        <p >Aspiring computer scientists are of just as great importance to the community <br />
          as are graduate computer scientists. Equipped with the appropriate resources and <br />
          drive towards excellence, undergrads can achieve lengths of great heights.<br />
          As the computer science community, we intend to nurture and cultivate our undergraduate<br />
          computer scientists into beings of utmost excellence.

          <h3>Available Opportunities For Certification</h3>
          <p>Whilst pursuing a degree, many undergradutes should also consider opportunities
              for program certification while still an undergradute. For such opportunities usually
              present themselves for less costs while still a student. In addition, a certified
              computer science graduate has an advantage over an un-certified graduate
              in the world of employment.<br/></p>
              <th>Such opportunities come in the form of:</th>
